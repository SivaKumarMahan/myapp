      'Whether you route jobs to on-prem or cloud runners by trust and data access, with a safe fallback.',
    answer: [
      'Use self-hosted runners for sensitive or on-prem workloads, cloud runners for elastic builds, and route jobs by label or tag. Mini-case: Database migrations ran on on-prem runners, while builds and tests ran on GCP runners. This kept both compliance and speed.',
      '**Detailed interview approach:** I classify each workload by data access, trust level, latency, and how elastic it needs to be. Builds that need private on-prem systems run on dedicated self-hosted pools, reached only through controlled network paths. Ordinary builds can use ephemeral cloud runners instead.',
      'Labels map a job to an approved pool. Untrusted pull requests never run on privileged internal agents. All runners use versioned images, short-lived identity, isolated workspaces, restricted egress, and no persistent secrets.',
      "I monitor queue time, provisioning failures, utilization, patch age, and network dependencies, and keep spare capacity in both locations. A hybrid design also needs a fallback rule, so a cloud outage doesn't accidentally send sensitive work to the wrong runner.",

    answer: [
      'Identify the tests that fail unpredictably, add retries with backoff (waiting longer between each retry), isolate shared resources, and watch job history trends. Mini-case: A flaky integration test broke builds one time in ten. Containerizing the test database eliminated the shared-state issue.',

I look for shared mutable test data, assumptions about timing or order, random seeds, dependence on external APIs, resource pressure, and race conditions.',
      'Logs capture the seed, test ID, and container and dependency versions — but never secrets. I isolate databases and queues per run, freeze or inject time, mock unstable external calls, and wait on health conditions instead of using fixed sleeps.',

      'Give each service a separate pipeline, build and push Docker images, deploy with Helm, and use shared monitoring and logging.',
      '**Detailed interview approach:** Each service gets its own pipeline, triggered independently based on which paths or repos changed, but all of them share versioned templates.',

      "- **Repo strategy:** Give each service its own pipeline. Use a mono-repo with path filters, or separate repos per service — either way, only build what changed.\n- **CI stage:** Lint, run unit tests, then build the container with a multi-stage Dockerfile. Run SAST and a dependency scan, then scan the image with Trivy. Push the image tagged with the Git SHA, so the tag never changes once it's pushed.\n- **CD stage (GitOps preferred):** Instead of having CI push the change directly, update the desired state in a Git repo that Argo CD or Flux watches. The cluster then reconciles itself — meaning it keeps changing until it matches what's in Git. You can also push with Helm or Kustomize straight from the pipeline if you're not using GitOps.\n- **Progressive delivery:** Deploy to staging, run automated tests, then roll out to production with canary or blue-green (Argo Rollouts or Flagger), with automatic rollback if an SLO is breached.\n- **Cross-cutting concerns:** environment promotion, secrets pulled from a vault, per-service versioning, observability hooks, and a plan for handling database migrations.",

Only reviewed configuration, capacity, endpoints, and credentials differ between them. Each environment keeps separate state and identity, and configuration follows a typed, validated schema with defaults.',
