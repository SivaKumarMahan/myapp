    answer: [
      "Azure DevOps is Microsoft's platform for the whole application lifecycle. Its main services are Azure Repos for source control, Pipelines for CI/CD, Boards for work tracking, Artifacts for packages, and Test Plans for test management.",
      'A typical flow links a Board work item to a branch and a pull request, runs build, test, and security checks in Pipelines, publishes a versioned package or image, deploys through protected environments, and records evidence of the deployment. Azure DevOps can deploy to Azure or to other platforms just as easily.',
      "I set up Entra-backed groups, access scoped to only what's needed, protected branches, workload-identity service connections, YAML templates, artifact retention, approvals, and audit logs. The real value here is being able to trace a change all the way from code to work item to build to artifact to release — not just running scripts.",

    probing:
      'Whether you know why YAML pipelines replaced classic UI pipelines and how you would migrate safely.',
    answer: [
      'Classic build and release pipelines are configured mostly through the UI. YAML pipelines live in the repository as code, which means they get code review, branching, templates, version history, and are easier to reuse.',
      'Classic releases still show up in older systems, or where a team just prefers managing stages through the UI.',
      "I prefer multi-stage YAML for new work. Changes to production logic go through pull-request review, and environment approvals and checks stay configured outside the YAML file itself, so a code change can't accidentally remove a safety gate.",
      'When migrating, I inventory the tasks, variables, service connections, approvals, artifacts, schedules, and retention settings, rebuild them in YAML and templates, run both pipelines side by side safely, compare the artifacts and deployments they produce, then retire the old credentials once the cutover is done.',

      'Whether you build one artifact and promote it through stages instead of rebuilding per environment.',
    answer: [
      'I build one artifact that never changes once built, then promote that same artifact through each stage:',
      "In a real pipeline, CI also scans the image and publishes it, staging runs smoke and integration tests, and production adds environment checks, approval, monitoring, and rollback. Templates standardize the jobs, but each environment's values and identities stay isolated from the others.",

    answer: [
      "A service connection stores how Azure Pipelines authenticates to something external — Azure, Kubernetes, GitHub, or a registry. I prefer Azure Resource Manager connections that use workload identity federation, so there's no long-lived client secret sitting around.",
      "I scope the identity to the smallest subscription, resource group, or resource role it needs, authorize it only for the pipelines that should use it, and keep non-production separate from production. Creating and using a connection is audited, ownership is documented, and connections nobody's using anymore get removed.",
      "If authentication fails, I check that the connection is verified, the tenant and subscription, the federated credential's subject, which pipelines are authorized to use it, the role and its scope, whether RBAC has propagated, the target's network or firewall, and whether the agent can even reach it. I test one allowed and one denied operation to actually prove least privilege is working.",

    answer: [
      'Variables hold reusable values. Variable groups share those values across pipelines and can link straight to Key Vault. Templates and parameters are better for decisions that need to be typed and fixed at compile time; variables are just runtime strings.',
      'I keep non-secret configuration in reviewed files or groups, and put actual secrets in Key Vault or protected secret variables. Production groups are authorized only for the pipelines that need them.',
      'I avoid ever echoing a secret, and I know masking output is a safety net, not a real guarantee.',
      'I also document how precedence works, since template, pipeline, stage, job, and queue-time values can all override each other. Reading the rendered pipeline and its logs helps track down an unexpected value without printing anything sensitive.',

    prompt: 'How do approvals and environments work in Azure Pipelines?',
    probing:
      'Whether you know that approvals and checks live on protected resources, outside the YAML a contributor can edit.',
    answer: [
      "An environment represents a deployment target and keeps a history of what's been deployed to it. Approvals and checks can require an authorized approver, a specific branch, business hours, an exclusive lock, an Azure Function or REST call for validation, or other gates before a deployment job is allowed to start.",
      "I keep the critical checks outside the application's YAML, so a pull request can't quietly remove them. The approval screen should show the artifact's digest, what changed, the risk, test and scan evidence, and the rollback plan. Production identity is only made available to that specific protected deployment.",
      "I test the approved, rejected, timed-out, and concurrent cases. Emergency bypass is tightly restricted and audited. Approval supports accountability, but it's not a substitute for automated health and policy checks.",
      'For YAML pipelines, configure **Approvals and checks** on the protected resource — usually an Azure DevOps environment, service connection, variable group, secure file, or agent pool.',
      "The resource owner controls these checks outside the pipeline's YAML, so a contributor can't remove a production approval just by editing the pipeline file.",
      'Useful checks include:',
      '- Manual approval by the correct production owner\n- Branch control requiring a protected release branch\n- Required templates\n- Business hours or change window\n- Azure Monitor alert query\n- Invoke Azure Function or REST API for an external policy decision\n- Exclusive lock to prevent overlapping production deployments',
      'Classic release pipelines still support pre-deployment approvals and gates, but new designs usually go with multistage YAML and protected environments instead. To actually enforce a Trivy scan result, make the scan stage fail on findings, publish the scan evidence, or expose an approved policy service through a supported check.',
      "Running Trivy earlier in the pipeline doesn't automatically make it a gate on its own.",
      'An approval is not a substitute for automated validation. The approver should be able to see the change, the exact artifact version, the test and scan results, which environment is affected, the deployment plan, health evidence, and how to roll back.',

    probing:
      'Whether you can describe a safe build-scan-push-deploy flow to AKS with health checks and rollback.',
    answer: [
      "The pipeline builds, tests, and scans an image, pushes its digest — a fixed reference that always points to that exact image — to ACR, then deploys it through Helm, plain manifests, or by updating a GitOps repository. Authentication uses workload identity or a service connection scoped to only what's needed.",
      "I set up probes, resource requests, a security context, a PodDisruptionBudget, and NetworkPolicy. Secrets come from Key Vault through the CSI driver. After deployment I check the rollout, events, smoke tests, and error rate and latency. If something's wrong, it triggers a rollback of traffic or the release, and the evidence is kept.",

      "I protect the repository and its YAML from unreviewed changes, restrict who can edit or queue pipelines, use workload-identity service connections scoped to the minimum needed, protect environments and variable groups, and isolate self-hosted agents. Untrusted pull requests can't reach production secrets or runners.",
      'Tasks, templates, and images are pinned to specific versions and reviewed. The pipeline runs secret, source, dependency, infrastructure-as-code, and image scans, publishes signed artifacts that never change once built, and keeps audit evidence. Secrets never end up in artifacts, cache, or logs.',

      'Templates are reusable YAML for stages, jobs, steps, or variables. They cut down on duplication and give teams an approved pattern for building, scanning, and deploying.',
      'I keep templates in a controlled repository, pin to a specific ref or tag, use typed parameters, document the inputs, and test changes against the teams actually using them. Breaking changes get proper versioning and migration guidance.',

      "I look at the logs, the timeline, any recent changes to YAML, templates, or tasks, agent demands and capabilities, disk, network, and DNS, permissions, variable scope, artifact paths, and the status of any external service involved. For a deployment failure, I also check the Azure Activity Log, AKS events, policy, quota, and the target's health.",
      "I reproduce it with the same tool image and parameters in a safe environment, fix the actual cause, rerun only the stage that's safe to repeat, and confirm the output downstream looks right. To prevent it happening again, I might pin a version, add an earlier check, add a timeout or more capacity, or make the error message clearer.",

      'Policies apply to branches like `main`, and can require a minimum number of reviewers, specific or automatic reviewers, resolved comments, linked work items, build validation, status checks, and restrictions on how merges happen.',
      'I require the relevant automated checks and reviewers for anything touching pipelines, infrastructure-as-code, or security-sensitive paths. I test policies with a normal account, and bypass access is limited to an audited emergency group.',
      "There's a balance between safety and speed — flaky or slow checks push people toward bypassing them. I track failed validations, how long reviews take, how often bypass gets used, and defects that show up after merge.

      "I block direct pushes to protected branches and require pull requests with a minimum number of reviewers. Sensitive paths automatically get required reviewers, an author can't approve their own change where separation of duties matters, comments have to be resolved, and build and security checks have to pass.",
      'A good pull request describes its purpose, risk, tests, deployment plan, and rollback plan. Reviewers look at correctness, security, operations, and any generated artifacts or plans — not just code style.',

      'Azure Repos supports merge commit, squash merge, rebase with fast-forward, and semi-linear merge, depending on policy.',
      '- **Merge** keeps the full branch history, but adds merge commits.\n- **Squash** collapses everything into one commit and cleans up noisy feature history.\n- **Rebase or fast-forward** gives a linear history, but rewrites the feature commits.\n- **Semi-linear** rebases first, then adds a merge commit — keeping things linear while still marking the pull-request boundary.',

      "I'm careful to avoid duplicate runs by understanding the difference between a CI trigger and a PR policy trigger, and I test the path filters. Pipeline resource triggers can kick off a downstream pipeline once an artifact has actually been published.",
