      'Whether you can define SLI, SLO and error budget and explain how a budget policy ties release speed to reliability.',
    answer: [
      'The core ideas I explain:',
      "- **SRE** applies software-engineering thinking to operations. You measure reliability with **SLIs** (like latency or availability), set a target called an **SLO** (say, 99.9%), and the gap between that and 100% is your **error budget** — the amount of unreliability you're allowed to spend.\n- **Error budget policy:** if the budget is healthy, ship features fast. If it's used up, freeze risky releases and put the focus on reliability until it recovers. This ties feature velocity to reliability in an objective way, instead of an argument.\n- **Other principles:** remove repetitive manual work through automation, run blameless postmortems, keep that manual work under roughly half of everyone's time, and watch the **four golden signals** — latency, traffic, errors, and saturation (how close a resource is to running out of capacity).",

    answer: [
      'The review process I use:',
      "- **Blameless:** focus on the systems and contributing factors, not on blaming a person.\n- **Structure:** a timeline of events, the impact (users affected, duration, SLO impact), how it was detected, the root cause (found through something like the 5 Whys), what went well and what didn't, and concrete follow-ups with an owner and a due date.\n- **Process:** any significant incident triggers one, write it up promptly, review it with stakeholders, track the follow-ups to completion, and share it across the org so others learn from it. The goal is fixing the system, not just this one incident.",

For **spiky traffic**, buffer it with queues (SQS/Kafka) plus KEDA. For **sudden node demand**, Karpenter provisions fast and cost-consciously, combined with spot instances.\n- Set real resource requests and limits, PodDisruptionBudgets, topology spread, and readiness probes, then load-test to confirm it all works, and keep an eye on cost.

      'Whether you can design a concrete multi-region DR setup with replication, failover routing and tested RTO/RPO.',
    answer: [
      'Multi-region AWS setup with us-east-1 as primary and us-west-2 for DR, Terraform with per-region state but shared modules, S3 cross-region replication plus DynamoDB global tables plus cross-region RDS snapshots, Argo CD GitOps per region, Route53 failover, and quarterly FIS drills validating RTO/RPO.',
      '**Detailed interview approach:** I build a full DR strategy on an AWS multi-region setup, with primary workloads in us-east-1 and DR components in us-west-2. Infrastructure is defined in Terraform, with separate state files per region but shared modules.',
      'I use S3 cross-region replication for static assets and DynamoDB global tables for distributed data. For stateful applications, I set up automated RDS snapshots with point-in-time recovery, copied across regions.',
      'EKS clusters use GitOps with Argo CD in each region, pulling from the same Git repository so configuration stays consistent.',
      'Route53 health checks with failover routing automatically redirect traffic during a region failure. I run quarterly DR drills with AWS Fault Injection Simulator to confirm the actual recovery time (RTO) and recovery point (RPO) meet the targets.',
